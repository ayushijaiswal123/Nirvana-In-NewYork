          <h4>Theatres and Performing Arts</h4>
          <p>The 39 venues that make up Broadway are iconic theater destinations but New York's number and variety of theatrical performance venues are for more expansive. Off-Broadway shows usually take place in smaller theaters and are less pricey, while Off-Off-Broadway shows are downright obscure, but most likely to please more avant-garde theater lovers. New York City also boasts some of the most high-profile music and dance venues and companies in the world.</p>

        <div class="light">
          <h4>Parks</h4>
          <p>It may seem surprising that the most populous metropolitan area in the world is known for its parks, but consider that New York City is home to Central Park, the world's most visited green space. Central Park is home to the Reservoir, Belvedere Castle, an ice skating rink, a carosel, public tennis courts, walking and bike paths, and a host of other attractions. Summerstage, which features free live music throughout the summer season, has also played host to a number of legendary concerts.</p>

        <div class="city">
          <h4>Cuisine</h4>
          <p>New York City cuisine encompasses virtually every kind of ethnic cuisine in the known world. This is in large part because of the plethora of neighborhoods that serve as enclaves of particular cuisines and cultures, but you can also find all types of fare across each of New York's five borough's be on the look out for delis and street vendors peddling hot dogs, Indian food, smoothies and vegetarian lunches. Food trucks are situated all over the city, offering top quality fare such as gourmet takes on cupcakes, sandwiches, ice cream and coffee.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="vienna">
          <h4>Museums and Galleries</h4>
          <p>In addition to its numerous major museums and galleries (which, it goes without saying, are some of the finest in the world) New York boasts hundreds of small, private galleries, many concentrated in the Chelsea neighborhood. Major museums like the Guggenheim, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, The Frick Museum, The Jewish Museum, and the American Museum of Natural History are international destinations. Brooklyn and Queens have as much to offer as Manhattan.</p>

        <div class="italian">
          <h4>Sports</h4>
          <p>From historic sports venues to distinguished teams that have captivated (and at times, enraged) fans all around the world, New York is a city that loves sports. The Big Apple is the only metropolitan area in the United States with more than one team in each of America's four major sports; indeed, New York boasts nine.</p>

More than a century later, the lights and action are even brighter. The very mention of this neon neighborhood causes many a New Yorker’s eyes to roll, but every first-time visitor should see Times Square—especially at night. Watch the show unfold from an elevated seat on the red steps near Duffy Square.New York’s wackiest and most wonderful characters enter the stage as costumed superheroes such as Batman and Lady of Liberty.
